    "Bartosz Milewski has remarked that the basic concepts of concetual mathematics or category theory can be explained in relatively simple terms to anybody with some experience of programming. This module is designed to give just that experience to Key Stage 2-3 students and teachers. He writes, \"like programming category theory is about structure. Mathematicians discover structure in mathematical theories, programmers discover structure in computer programs. Well structured programs are easier to understand and maintain, and are less likely to to contain bugs.\" Category theory provides the language to talk about structure, and learning it will make you a better programmer, teacher or mathematician.\n",

    "Willem Van Onsem who charaterised Haskell's standard type classes in this way suggests that a good way to visualise the difference is through topology: Floating types are connected spaces, i.e. they form a continuum. What this means for floating point numbers is: every value is understood as a whole interval of real numbers (because floating-point always has some uncertainty). When you lay these intervals side by side, you tile the entire real numbers (at least to ±10^300) without gaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, some Fractional types are not connected. In particular, Rational can exactly represent all its (rational-number) values, so each value is just an “infinitely small point”. You can never cover the entire real line with such points, and you can not compute functions like sin or log since the result of these functions is usually a non-rational real number.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth pondering a bit what this “decent approximation” means. The Haskell standard doesn't define this. This story about every floating point number representing a whole interval of real numbers captures it quite well IMO. More generally, we might say: Num/Fractional/Floating are the classes of types that represent equivalance classes of integer/rational/real numbers. In fact, these classes need not even be “small” intervals: in particular the finite types like Word32 or the standard Int can be understood in a modular arithmetic sense, manifesting in results like (2^70 :: Int) == 0, i.e. the equivalence classes are then numbers spaces by a multiple of 264.\n",
    "\n",
    "In cases like Integer or Rational, the equivalence classes actually contain only a single element, i.e. the numbers are represented exactly. For real numbers, this is actually also possible, but much more tricky, it's called exact real arithmetic. "
